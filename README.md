## My process

First set the HTML structure with divs and then styling the page accordingly. I have used flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Getting the right width and centering the objects are some of the things I have struggled with. Thankfully I have learned it and I can now implement the same concepts in any future projects.

### Continued development

I definately want to continue developing my skills in making a responsive website.
